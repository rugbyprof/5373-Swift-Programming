## Program 0 - Slider Game
#### Due Sunday the 15th by Midnight

- Must be uploaded into your github repository.
- This is the first "tutorial" in iOS Apprentice Chapter 1
- The chapter can be obtained here (it's free): [The_iOS_Apprentice_1-Getting_Started](http://cs.mwsu.edu/~griffin/swift/The_iOS_Apprentice_1-Getting_Started.zip)
- Don't just pick through the chapter enough to get the program done. It gives a lot of good information about the IDE, a lot more than I can cover in class.

- Since we have spent time on the actual language semantics, and I haven't really assigned a "program" until just recently, I think this will be a good starter. 
- I will move the due date of Program_1 (actually the second one now) and make it due Feb 24<sup>th</sup> by class time.
- I will pick up next week finishing our Treasure game, then jump into chapter 2 of iOS Apprentice which deals with table views but a lot more in depth than the last book.
