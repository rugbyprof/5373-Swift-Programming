## Program 0 - Slider Game
#### Due Sunday the 15th by Midnight

- Must be uploaded into your github repository.
- This is the first "tutorial" in iOS Apprentice Chapter 1
- The book can be obtained here: http://cs.mwsu.edu/~griffin/swift/iOS_Apprenctice_8_Swift.zip


- Since we have spent time on the actual language semantics, and I haven't really assigned a "program" until just recently, I think this will be a good starter. 
- I will move the due date of Program_1 (actually the second program now).
